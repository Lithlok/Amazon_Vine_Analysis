# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

Overview of the analysis: The purpose of this analysis is to provide a breakdown of Amazon Vine paid reviews of the Outdoor dataset, and to ascertain if the expense provides a positive return in the form of 5 star reviews. In this analysis we look at all reviews and then break it down by paid and unpaid reviews (Vine and non-Vine), and focus in on the data in a very precise manner.


## Results: Using bulleted lists and images of DataFrames as support, address the following questions:

## Summary
In Summary, I do not feel that there is any positivity bias in this dataset's reviews, as Vine percentage is 52.34% and non-Vine is 52.69% of 5 star reviews within the total. I do not see that there is a correlation, especially given the amount of Vine reviews(107) compared to non-Vine reviews(39,869). If i could analyze further, i would look at which specific products render the 5 star reviews from each subset and cater the Vine services offered ata lower rate.
